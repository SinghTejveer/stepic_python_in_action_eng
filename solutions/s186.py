from the shortest to the longest word (see the example).

A word is a sequence of arbitrary characters surrounded by spaces or line
boundaries. Note that punctuation marks also belong to a word.

Input format:
A string containing a sequence of Latin characters and punctuation marks,
separated by a space.

Output format:
For each word length that appears in the original string, you need to specify
the number of words with such length in a format:

length: amount

Output this information in the order of increasing length.
