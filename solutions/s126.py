"""
Given six real numbers â€“ a, b, c, d, e, f. Solve the following system of linear
equations:

    ax + by = e
    cx + dy = f

    4x + 0y = 5
    0x + 0y = 0

Output format

  - If the system has no solution, then the program should print a single
    number 0.

  - If the system has infinitely many solutions, each of which looks like
    y = kx + b, then the program should print the number 1,
    and then the values k and b.

  - If the system has a single solution (x0, y0), then the program should print
    the number 2, and then the values x0 and y0.

  - If the system has infinitely many solutions that look like x=x0 with any y,
    then the program should output the number 3, and then the value x0.

  - If the system has infinitely many solutions that look like y=y0 with any x,
    then the program should output the number 4, and then the value y0.

  - If any pair of numbers (x,y) is a solution, the program should output
    the number 5.
