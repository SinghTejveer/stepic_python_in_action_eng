"""
The interest rate on the deposit is P percent per annum, which are added to the
deposit amount after one year. The deposit is X dollars Y cents. Find the size
of the deposit in K years.

Input data format

Integers P, X, Y, K.

Output data format

The program should output two numbers: the size of the deposit in K years in
dollars and cents. Fractional parts of cents after a year should be discarded.
Recalculation of the deposit amount (discarding the fractional parts of cents)
occurs annually.

Note: If you are facing issues with accuracy in this problem â€“ try to solve it
using only integer numbers.

Sample Input:

    12
    179
    0
    5

Sample Output:
